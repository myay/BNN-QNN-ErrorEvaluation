# BNN-QNN-ErrorEvaluation
A framework for error tolerance training and evaluation of Binarized and Quantized Neural Networks

## CUDA-based Binarization, Quantization, and Error Injection

For fast binarization/quantization and error injection during training, CUDA support is needed. To enable it, install pybind11 and CUDA toolkit.

Then, to install the CUDA-kernels, go to the folder ```code/cuda/``` and run

```./install_kernels.sh```

After successful installation of all kernels, run the binarization/quantization-aware training with error injection for BNNs using

```python3 run_fashion_binarized_fi.py --batch-size=256 --epochs=10 --lr=0.001 --step-size=2 --gamma=0.5 --test-error```,

and for QNNs using

```python3 run_fashion_quantized_fi.py --batch-size=256 --epochs=10 --lr=0.0001 --step-size=5 --gamma=0.5 --test-error```.

The code is an extension based on the MNIST example in https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist.
